# ProjetInfo

This project was made by four students from Telecom SudParis: Arthur Oulmi, Fabien Bertin, Jean Hilbrunner and Richard Nguyen,
as a part of a computer science project.

It is a turn-based strategy game heavily inspired by Advance Wars, Final Fantasy Tactics and Fire Emblems.

The keys to play the game are:
A to select a cell/an option from a menu, B to cancel a choice or to choose a unit/building/ground type in creation mode, 
Enter to call the menu, R to remove a cell in creation mode. 

The rules are simple:
Each player have several building and units.
There are two types of building: one to summon more unit (the cyan portal) and another to generate resources for summoning. (the golden floating crystal)
To win, the player have to capture all the summoning portal of the oponents or have them surrender.
Units have different range of movement/attack, type of attack, HP, and speed of capture.

Only two armies are playable at moment: the first one is an insect army and the second one is the undead army. The last one was planned to be chinese
mythological army but only one sprite has been made.

//To play, you can either launch an IDE like eclipse and Run the Main or simply execute DimensionalWar.jar
For more information about how the code is structured you can check out the folder Diagramme. It is available in both English and French.
